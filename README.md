## Getting started

1. Fork this repository

3. Solve it!

### Step-by-Step Guide for Beginners

Here's a simple guide to get you started:

- First, make sure you have Node installed.
- Although we prefer using `yarn` to run commands, it's not a requirement.
- After forking the repo, creating a new branch, and installing the dependencies, check the `package.json` file for the scripts section.
  - To invoke a script, use either `yarn` or `npm` followed by `${COMMAND}`.
  - The commands are straightforward, but you'll probably only need to use `yarn dev`.

## Tips

- Write a README.
- We provided wireframes - treat them as guidelines only.
- Prefer tooling included, but we're open to see your tools

**BUT DON'T USE PHP**
